### Problem Statement

In today’s digital age, the need for secure storage of sensitive information is more critical than ever. With the increasing number of cyber threats, individuals and businesses alike are concerned about the privacy and security of their data. While there are numerous note-taking applications available, many lack robust security features, leaving user data vulnerable to unauthorized access. This project aims to address these concerns by developing a **Secure Notes Application** that prioritizes data privacy and security, ensuring that users can store, manage, and access their notes with confidence.

### Project Goals
- Develop a user-friendly notes application with a focus on security and privacy.
- Implement strong authentication and encryption mechanisms to protect user data.
- Ensure that users have complete control over who can access their notes.

### Requirements

#### **1. User Authentication**
   - **Sign Up / Login:**
     - Users must be able to sign up with a username and password.
     - Implement secure password storage using bcrypt or Argon2.
     - Include email verification to activate accounts.
   - **Authentication:**
     - Implement JWT-based authentication to handle user sessions.
     - Support OAuth2 login via third-party providers (e.g., Google, GitHub) as an optional feature.
   - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
     - Optional, but recommended, to enhance account security.

#### **2. Notes Management**
   - **Create, Edit, and Delete Notes:**
     - Users can create, edit, and delete notes.
     - Notes should be automatically encrypted before being stored in the database.
   - **Data Encryption:**
     - Implement AES-256 encryption to ensure that all notes are stored securely.
     - Each note is encrypted with a unique key tied to the user’s account credentials.
   - **Note Metadata:**
     - Store metadata such as the note’s creation date, last modified date, and tags (for easy categorization).

#### **3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - **User Roles:**
     - Implement roles such as regular user and admin.
     - Admins have access to additional functionalities like user management and system monitoring.
   - **Shared Notes:**
     - Allow users to share notes with specific individuals or groups.
     - Implement access levels (e.g., view-only, edit) for shared notes.

#### **4. Database Management**
   - **Database Choice:**
     - Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for storing user data and notes.
   - **Schema Design:**
     - Design the database schema to include tables for users, notes, shared notes, and encryption keys.
   - **Data Backup and Recovery:**
     - Implement regular backups and provide a mechanism for data recovery in case of accidental deletion or corruption.

#### **5. Security Features**
   - **Encryption at Rest and in Transit:**
     - Ensure that all data is encrypted both at rest (in the database) and in transit (between client and server).
   - **Audit Logging:**
     - Implement audit logs to track user actions, such as logins, note creation, and deletions.
   - **Security Monitoring:**
     - Integrate monitoring tools to detect and alert on suspicious activities or potential security breaches.

#### **6. User Interface**
   - **Responsive Design:**
     - Create a clean, intuitive user interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
   - **Search and Filter:**
     - Implement search and filter options to help users quickly find specific notes.
   - **Tagging and Categorization:**
     - Allow users to tag and categorize notes for better organization.

#### **7. Additional Features (Optional)**
   - **Offline Mode:**
     - Allow users to access and edit notes offline, with changes syncing once reconnected to the internet.
   - **Versioning:**
     - Implement version control for notes, allowing users to revert to previous versions.
   - **Multi-Language Support:**
     - Provide support for multiple languages in the user interface.

### Deliverables
- A fully functional and secure notes application.
- Complete documentation of the codebase and encryption methods used.
- A deployment guide to help users set up the application on their own servers.
- Test cases and results demonstrating the security and functionality of the application.
